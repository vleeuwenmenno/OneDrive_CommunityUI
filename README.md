<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



I recently made the switch to 2 major things in my IT works. I swithced from ONLYOFFICE to using Office 365 for the 1TB storage which I had a server for with Nextcloud and from Windows 10 to Ubuntu 20.04.I noticed there's a solid onedrive command but there is no easy UI for it. So because I had nothing better to do I created one.

It uses the linux `onedrive` command line interface and `kdocker` to make this happen fluently.
